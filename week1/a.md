my research project  for the data visualization course .


*after checking the 5 code books the most the one that I ’m most interested in  working with is the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related  Conditions “NESARC” data set

*the first question I'm interested in is the relationship between  the age of the first   marriage and the level of education (HIGHEST GRADE OR YEAR OF  SCHOOL COMPLETED) and if they positively correlated or not



Hypothesis:
Child marriage is associated with lower levels of schooling for girls in every region of the world and is a barrier to international development goals.1 A lost opportunity for education is not only harmful for girls, but has wide-reaching repercussions for their children and communities. Educating girls creates many positive outcomes for economic development and poverty reduction by improving a girl’s income-earning potential and socio-economic status.

the variables the will be used to answer this question are :
AGE AT FIRST MARRIAGE “S1Q4A”
HIGHEST GRADE OR YEAR OF SCHOOL COMPLETED”S1Q6A”

The second question I’m going to study is the relationship between the (ORIGIN OR DESCENT) and level of ‘Educational achievement’.

the variables the will be used to answer this question are :

DRINKING STATUS ”CONSUMER”

HOW OFTEN DRANK LARGEST NUMBER OF COOLERS IN LAST 12 MONTHS “S2AQ4F”

HOW OFTEN DRANK BEER IN LAST 12 MONTHS ”S2AQ5B”

HOW OFTEN DRANK 5+ BEERS IN LAST 12 MONTHS ”S2AQ5G”

HIGHEST GRADE OR YEAR OF SCHOOL COMPLETED “S1Q6A”

Hypothesis:

In this article we explore the relationship between education and alcohol consumption. We examine whether the probability of abusing alcohol differs across educational groups. We use data from the British Cohort Study, a longitudinal study of one week's birth in Britain in 1970. We analysed data collected at age 34 (in 2004) and complement it with information gathered at previous sweeps. Measures of alcohol abuse include alcohol consumption above NHS guidelines, daily alcohol consumption and problem drinking. We found that higher educational attainment is associated with increased odds of daily alcohol consumption and problem drinking. The relationship is stronger for females than males. Individuals who achieved high educational test scores in childhood are at a significantly higher risk of abusing alcohol across all dimensions. Our results also suggest that educational qualifications and academic performance are associated with the probability of belonging to different typologies of alcohol consumers among women while this association is not present in the case of educational qualifications and is very weak in the case of academic performance among males.
